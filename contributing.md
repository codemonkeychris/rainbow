# Contributing to Rainbow
Right now this is pretty much just for me (Chris Anderson, aka @codemonkeychris) to hack with. If you want
to contribute, i'll have to work out a CLA (there is a stock one for Microsoft), but if you work at MSFT
then you can just email me at `chrisan`.

## Pre-checkin validation
Before you issue a pull request, please do the following:
1. Run `tests/index.html`, everything should pass
2. Run each of the HTML files in the root, everything should render the same as before your change

Yes, this should be automated

## CLA
Needs to be worked out
